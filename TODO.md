# TODO
- Check for serializer
- Append proper serialization to SpREAD handler
  - Maybe add a "serializeBody" function template that is called on the entity, but the logic is swapped out for whatever serializer the user uses?
- Implement the rest of the basic requests
- Maybe add some way to staple on more routes?
